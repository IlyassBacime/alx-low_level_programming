This is a repo for C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings, it includes projects done in the alx software engineering programme

The different projects are as follows:

0) 0-memset.c : Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte

1) 1-memcpy.c : Write a function that copies memory area

2) 2-strchr.c : Write a function that locates a character in a string

3) 3-strspn.c : Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring

4) 4-strpbrk.c : Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes

5) 5-strstr.c : Write a function that locates a substring

6) 7-print_chessboard.c : Write a function that prints the chessboard

7) 8-print_diagsums.c : Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
