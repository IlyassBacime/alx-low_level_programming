This is a repo for C - Doubly linked lists, it includes different projects done in the alx software engineering

The different projects are as follows:

0) 0-print_dlistint.c : Writes a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list

1) 1-dlistint_len.c : Writes a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list

2) 2-add_dnodeint.c : Writes a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list

3) 3-add_dnodeint_end.c : Writes a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list

4) 4-free_dlistint.c : Writes a function that frees a dlistint_t list

5) 5-get_dnodeint.c : Writes a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list

6) 6-sum_dlistint.c : Writes a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list

7) 7-insert_dnodeint.c : Writes a function that inserts a new node at a given position

8) 8-delete_dnodeint.c : Writes a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list

9) 100-password : Finds the password for crackme4

10) 102-result : A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99

11) 103-keygen.c : Writes a keygen for crackme5
