This is a repo for C - More pointers, arrays and strings, it includes different projects in the alx software engineering programme

The different projects are as follows:

0) 0-strcat.c : Writes a function that concatenates two strings

1) 1-strncat.c : Writes a function that concatenates two strings

2) 2-strncpy.c : Writes a function that copies a string

3) 3-strcmp.c : Writes a function that compares two strings

4) 4-rev_array.c : Writes a function that reverses the content of an array of integers

5) 5-string_toupper.c : Writes a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

6) 6-cap_string.c : Writes a function that capitalizes all words of a string

7) 7-leet.c : Writes a function that encodes a string into 1337

8) 100-rot13.c : Writes a function that encodes a string using rot13

9) 101-print_number.c : Writes a function that prints an integer

10) 102-magic.c : Adds one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98

11) 103-infinite_add.c : Writes a function that adds two numbers

12) 104-print_buffer.c : Writes a function that prints a buffer
